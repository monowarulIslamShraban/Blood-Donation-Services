## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need a local server environment that supports PHP and MySQL. The most common setup is using **XAMPP**, but WAMP or MAMP are also suitable alternatives.

*   [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
    Or simply download the project files as a ZIP.

2.  **Place Project in Server Directory:**
    *   Move the entire project folder (`blood_donation_services`) into the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/`).

3.  **Start Apache and MySQL:**
    *   Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.

4.  **Create the Database:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
    *   Click on the **"Databases"** tab.
    *   Create a new database named `blood_donation_services`.
    *   Select the newly created database and go to the **"Import"** tab.
    *   Click **"Choose File"** and select the `blood_donation_services.sql` file located in the `database_file` directory of the project.
    *   Click **"Go"** to import the database schema and data.

5.  **Database Connection:**
    *   This project does not use a centralized configuration file. If the application fails to connect to the database, you may need to manually update the database credentials (`hostname`, `username`, `password`, `database name`) at the top of each `.php` file that interacts with the database.

6.  **Run the Application:**
    *   You can now access the application by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:
        ```
        http://localhost/blood_donation_services/
        ```
